# EmbyTelegramBot

Original author: [https://github.com/Fahmula/jellyfin-telegram-notifier]

This is a small flask python application that will send notifications to Telegram when new content is added to Emby.  

I've made small changes to the original application to allow for any content to be sent to Telegram excluding the filters:
EPISODE_PREMIERED_WITHIN_X_DAYS and SEASON_ADDED_WITHIN_X_DAYS.

Sample notification example here:
